Our themem was a given: Code for Change. We decided if the world needs a thing in particular to be changed, pollution is definitely a prime contender. Our project is a game that requires the user to interact with unethical people who throw trash out of their building windows. The user is being timed, and if you allow a specific amount of filthy items to lay on the ground at a corresponding time, you lose, and have therefore failed to help Change.

Demo:

The user will start in the center. After learning how to play, the items from the horrendous people will begin to fall from the "sky". As the items hit the ground, the user will run to pick up the items and place them in their correct bins. The user will pick up litter with a simple walk-over, and then run back to the correct dumpster to place them. However, if the user goes to the incorrect bin, the user will recieve 1 strike. Each time the user receives 3 strikes, they will have failed to help Change. The user will reciprocally fail to help Change if they allow a set number of items to be on the ground at one time.
